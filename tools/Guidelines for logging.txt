This folder contains tools and guide-lines used for doing the
various logs.

1°) My first method (with TI-GraphLink software):

Tools used :
- DSP Starter Kit (DSK),
- or AVRanalyzer + RS232 sampler.

Some offsets used by my DSK tools for storing data:
- CblExpmt: 31000
- Conics (acf2b3e.8xk): 22000
- ProbSi83: 36000 ?
- ChemBio: 23000
- TI83PlusOS114.8XU: 260000

RS232 sampler provides an hexdump log which can be processed with log2pkt.exe.

2°) My second method (with Ti-Connect software)

Use SnoopyPro (UsbSnoopy) to sniff USB packet and get an XML log.
The XML log can be processed with xml2log and next with log2pkt.


3°) When the hand-held is not available but the TI emulator is:

- fastAVRlink/GrayLink on COM2 (TiLP)
- DSK on the 'T'
- GreyLink on COM1 (TI's SDK)
