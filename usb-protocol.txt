======================================================================

1  Introduction
---------------

 This represents my current understanding of the protocol used to
 communicate with the OS and boot code of the TI-84 Plus.  It is based
 mainly on:

  - Logs of the communication between the calculator and TI-Connect,
    obtained by Romain Liévin and Dan Englender;

  - My own analysis of the boot code and OS of the TI-84 Plus SE.

 I've been investigating the 84 Plus because that's the calculator I'm
 more familiar with.  Nevertheless it looks like a lot of this is
 applicable to the TI-89 Titanium as well.

 Since I don't, as of this writing, have one of these calculators to
 play with, I haven't personally tested any of this!

 Now, on with the protocol...


2  Raw Packets
--------------

 All data sent over USB is encoded as part of a "raw packet."  These
 packets have a fixed maximum size specified by the calculator: 255
 bytes for the 84 Plus, or 1023 bytes for the Titanium.  It seems that
 a raw packet may or may not be sent as a single USB transfer (but
 sending more than one raw packet as a single transfer is probably not
 wise.)

 Raw packets have a five-byte header followed by an n-byte data
 section:

  LL LL LL LL   TT   DD ...

 where

  LLLLLLLL = length of the data section;
  TT = packet type;
  DD = data bytes (LLLLLLLL of them.)

 It should be noted that, unlike the DBUS protocol, the length is
 transmitted in big endian order (most significant byte first.)  In
 fact, all 16- and 32-bit numbers sent as part of the USB protocol
 (with the exception of numbers that are actually part of variable
 data) are transmitted in big-endian order.

 For example,

   0x00000004  0x01  0x00 0x00 0x04 0x00

   0x00000002  0x05  0xE0 0x00

   0x00000010  0x04  0x00 0x00 0x00 0x0A 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x03
                     0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x07 0xD0

 are all valid and complete raw packets.

 There are five types of raw packets, indicated by the TT field:

   TT = 1: Buffer Size Request
   TT = 2: Buffer Size Allocation
   TT = 3: Virtual Packet Data with Continuation
   TT = 4: Virtual Packet Data Final
   TT = 5: Virtual Packet Data Acknowledgement

 Each of these plays its own crucial role in the protocol, and each
 will be discussed in the following sections.


3  Buffer Size Negotiation
--------------------------

 Before any real communication can take place, one crucial question
 must be settled: how big can a single raw packet be?  At the moment
 the TI-84 Plus limits incoming and outgoing raw packets to 255 bytes,
 and the 89 Titanium limits them to 1023 bytes, yet that may change in
 the future.

 The device wishing to initiate communication, therefore, begins by
 sending a type 1 (Buffer Size Request) raw packet.  The contents of
 this packet are a 32-bit integer (big endian, remember) which is the
 largest size of raw packet the device is willing to handle.  Note
 that this length does not include the header; so the TI-84 Plus,
 which can handle a total raw packet size of 255 bytes, sends the
 number 0xFA, or 250. 
 
 The Titanium sends the number 0x3FF or 1023 but acts slightly differently.
 It should handle 1028 bytes but instead sends 5 bytes of header and next,
 1023 bytes.

 The receiving device must then decide whether the chosen buffer size
 is acceptable, or whether it must be made smaller still.  (For
 example, TI-Connect gives a maximum packet size of one kilobyte,
 which is too large for the TI-84 Plus to handle.)  The receiving
 device chooses a buffer size acceptable to both parties and sends a
 type 2 (Buffer Size Allocation) raw packet, whose contents are a
 32-bit integer equal to the chosen size.

 The complete negotiation between TI-Connect and a TI-84 Plus thus
 goes as follows:

 TI-Connect sends 9 bytes stating that it can send and receive packets
 up to one kilobyte:

  PC->TI: 0x00000004  0x01  0x00000400

 The calculator requires a smaller buffer, and replies:

  TI->PC: 0x00000004  0x02  0x000000FA

 Now both parties have agreed on a buffer size (0xFA.)  Of course,
 both devices should now take care not to send packets larger than
 this size.

 It seems that this negotiation must be done at the start of every
 "operation;" after the communication is finished, the calculator will
 forget about the previously established buffer size.


4  Virtual Packets
------------------

 250 bytes is never enough, though.  To actually send data back and
 forth we want to be able to send blocks of arbitrary size.  This is
 where virtual packets come in.

 A virtual packet is always sent as the payload of one or more raw
 packets.  Specifically, it is sent as the payload of zero or more
 type 3 (Virtual Packet Data with Continuation) raw packets followed
 by a single type 4 (Virtual Packet Data Final) raw packet.  Only one
 virtual packet may be sent at a time; each virtual packet thus ends
 with its own type 4 raw packet.  The virtual packet is then obtained
 by concatenating the contents of the raw packets, in order.

 So what is the actual structure of a virtual packet?  Very much like
 the structure of a raw packet, yet subtly different.  It has a
 six-byte header instead of five:

  LL LL LL LL   TT TT   DD ...

 where, like a raw packet,

  LLLLLLLL = length of the data section;
  TTTT = packet type;
  DD = data bytes (LLLLLLLL of them.)

 Thus there can potentially be as many as 65536 different virtual
 packet types defined.  At the moment there are only about 22 of them,
 yet there is room for expansion.

 An example is sorely needed at this point.  Here is a fairly common
 packet, the standard "ping," as it would be sent in a single type 4
 raw packet:

  0x00000010  0x04
   0x0000000A  0x0001
    0x00 0x03 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x07 0xD0

 Note that the length of this virtual packet's data section is 10, or
 0x0A.  But the header is an additional 6 bytes, which brings the
 total size of the raw packet's data section to 0x10.

 The same virtual packet could also be sent (though it generally
 isn't) as a type 3 followed by a type 4:

  0x00000008  0x03
   0x0000000A  0x0001
    0x00 0x03

  0x00000008  0x04
    0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x07 0xD0

 The actual distribution of data between the raw packets is not
 important; in either case the calculator will "unwrap" the same 16
 bytes.

 Finally, each type 3 or type 4 raw packet must be acknowledged by the
 receiving device; this acknowledgement takes the form of a type 5
 (Virtual Packet Data Acknowledgement) raw packet.  The contents of
 this packet are always the 16-bit number 0xE000.  I have no idea why.

 So the complete transmission of a 10-byte ping, beginning with the
 buffer size negotiation, looks like this:

  PC->TI: 0x00000004  0x01  0x00000400

  TI->PC: 0x00000004  0x02  0x000000FA

  PC->TI: 0x00000010  0x04
           0x0000000A  0x0001
            0x00 0x03 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x07 0xD0

  TI->PC: 0x00000002  0x05  0xE000

 From now on I will ignore all of these details.  Where I write that
 the calculator "sends a virtual packet with XXXX as its contents"
 this implies that the appropriate data will be encoded and sent as a
 series of type 3 and 4 raw packets, and of course the PC will
 acknowledge each one.


5  Virtual Packet Types
-----------------------

 The following are the types of virtual packets I have been able to
 identify thus far.  There may be more out there.

  TTTT      Description
  0x0001    Ping / Set Mode
  0x0002    Begin OS Transfer
  0x0003    Acknowledgement of OS Transfer
  0x0004	OS Header (signature)
  0x0005    OS Data
  0x0006    Acknowledgement of EOT
  0x0007    Parameter Request
  0x0008    Parameter Data
  0x0009    Request Directory Listing
  0x000A    Variable Header
  0x000B    Request to Send
  0x000C    Request Variable
  0x000D    Variable Contents
  0x000E    Parameter Set
  0x0010    Delete Variable/Application
  0x0011    Remote Control
  0x0012    Acknowledgement of Mode Setting
  0xAA00    Acknowledgement of Data
  0xBB00    Delay Acknowledgement
  0xDD00    End of Transmission
  0xEE00    Error


 Type 0x0001: Ping / Set Mode
 ----------------------------

  The "ping" packet is sent to begin every transmission, immediately
  following the buffer size negotiation.  In fact, it must always be
  the first packet sent, as it determines the set of commands the
  calculator will accept.  The contents of this packet are:

   MM MM MM MM MM MM XX XX XX XX

  MMMMMMMMMMMM = mode ID;
  XXXXXXXX = unknown.

  The 84 Plus checks XXXXXXXX to be between 2000 and 131071
  (inclusive.)  I have no idea what this represents.  If it is too
  small, an 0x001C error is sent; if it is too big, an 0x001D error is
  sent.

  Next, MMMMMMMMMMMM is checked.  This determines what types of
  packets will be allowed in the following transmission.  The
  following mode ID's are accepted by the 84 Plus OS:

   0x000100010000  Startup mode; only ping is accepted.

   0x000200010000  Basic mode; ping, OS transfer, and parameter
                   request are accepted.

   0x000300010000  Normal operation mode; ping, parameter request,
		   directory listing, request to send, request
		   variable, parameter set, variable delete, and
		   command 0x0011 are accepted.

  The 84 Plus boot code only accepts the first two mode ID's.

  If the mode ID is acceptable, a type 0x0012 (Acknowledgement of Mode
  Setting) is sent in response.  This contains the value of XXXXXXXX.


 Type 0x0002: Begin OS Transfer
 ------------------------------

  This packet begins an OS transfer (or maybe also a certificate
  transfer?)  It's only accepted in mode 2.  An 0x0003
  (Acknowledgement of OS Transfer) is sent in response.  
  
  The contents of this packet are:

	XX XX XX XX XX XX XX HH HL LH LL

  XXXXXXXX = unknown.
  HHHLLHLL = size of OS data plus header (page, offset and flag), TI84+ only
  HHHLLHLL = size of OS data, Titanium only


 Type 0x0003: Acknowledgement of OS Transfer
 -------------------------------------------

  This packet is sent in response to an 0x0002 packet.  Its contents
  is the following:

   HH HL LH LL 00 00 00 00

  where HHHLLHLL is the maximum allowed size of an 0x0005 packet.


 Type 0x0004: OS Header ?
 ------------------------

  This packet is sent before sending OS data. It may contains the header.
  Same format as packet type 0x0005.


 Type 0x0005: OS Data
 --------------------

  This packet contains OS data.  It is analogous to a combination of
  the VAR and XDP packets in the DBUS protocol.  Its contents are:

   AA AA PP FF DD ...

  AAAA = Z80 logical address to write data (zero for header and
         signature)
  PP = page to write data (zero for header and signature)
  FF = flag (zero for normal data, 0x80 for header or signature)
  DD = OS data, up to 256 bytes.


 Type 0x0006: Acknowledgement of EOT
 -----------------------------------

  This packet is sent in response to an 0xdd00 (End of Transmission)
  packet.  It seems it is only sent in Flash transfers.  Its first
  byte is 1 if validation succeeded, or 0 if it failed.


 Type 0x0007: Parameter Request
 ------------------------------

  This packet requests calculator "parameters". This packet's contents are

  NN NN ( II II ) ...

  NNNN = number of parameters requested;
  IIII = 16-bit ID of each parameter requested.

  For example, sending a type 0x0007 packet containing
	0x0001 0x0002
  requests parameter number 2, which happens to be the product name.


 Type 0x0008: Parameter Data
 ---------------------------

  This packet is sent in response to an 0x0007 (Parameter Request)
  packet, whose contents are:

  NN NN ( II II VV [ LL LL DD ... ] ) ...

  NNNN = number of parameters requested;
  for each parameter:
   IIII = 16-bit parameter ID;
   VV = 0 if the given parameter ID is valid, 1 if it isn't;
	and if VV = 0:
    LLLL = length of the parameter data;
    DD = parameter data (LLLL bytes.)

  So for parameter 0x0002, the calculator might reply with a type
  0x0008 packet containing:

   0x0001                    (one parameter requested)
    0x0002                   (parameter number 2)
    0x00                     (parameter is valid)
    0x0019                   (parameter data is 0x19 bytes long)

    0x54 0x49 0x2D 0x38      (parameter data: in this case, an
    0x34 0x20 0x50 0x6C	     ASCII string)
    0x75 0x73 0x20 0x53
    0x69 0x6C 0x76 0x65
    0x72 0x20 0x45 0x64
    0x69 0x74 0x69 0x6F
    0x6E

  Multiple parameters can be requested at once; for example a type
  0x0007 packet could contain:

  0x0004 0x0002 0x000E 0x0011 0x0025

  if you wanted to retrieve not only the product name, but also the
  amount of free RAM, free archive space, and the current time from the
  calculator's clock.


 Type 0x0009: Request Directory Listing
 --------------------------------------

  This packet requests a directory listing.  Each packet sent in reply
  will contain both the variable name and certain variable attributes;
  this packet allows you to specify which attributes you're interested
  in.  Its contents should be:

   NN NN NN NN ( II II ) ... 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x01 0x01
                             \---------- ?????????? ----------/

  NNNNNNNN = number of variable attributes requested;
  IIII = 16-bit ID of each attribute requested.

  The calculator will reply with a series of 0x000A packets, each
  containing a variable name and the requested attributes.


 Type 0x000A: Variable Header
 ----------------------------

  This packet is sent either
   (a) as part of a directory listing; or
   (b) in response to an 0x000C (Request Variable) packet.

  In addition to the name, it can contain zero or more variable
  "attributes," which can be any sort of variable metadata (type,
  size, archived state, perhaps the folder name...)

  The contents of this packet are (TI84+):

   LL LL UU ... 0x00 | NN NN ( II II VV [ JJ JJ DD ... ] ) ...
                \__/
				 |
				 NULL terminator

  The contents of this packet are (Titanium):

   LL UU ... 0x00 LL UU ... 0x00 | NN NN ( II II VV [ JJ JJ DD ... ] ) ...
      \_________/    \_________/
	    folder		   varname

  Note that the header changes between TI84+ & Titanium (vars only, FLASH app follows the
  same scheme as TI84+). The same header apply for 0x000B, 0x000C and 0x0010 packets. 
  You will have to update them consequently...

  Kevin Kofler says that a generic format for all hand-helds could be:

   LL MM UU ... 0x00 | NN NN ( II II VV [ JJ JJ DD ... ] ) ... 
   LL UU ... 0x00 MM UU ... 0x00 | NN NN ( II II VV [ JJ JJ DD ... ] ) ...
   In fact, if variable name is empty, size is set to 0 and no name is provided at all.

  LL = length of variable's name;
  UU = variable name in UTF-8 (LLLL bytes);
  NNNN = number of variable attributes;
  for each attribute:
   IIII = 16-bit attribute ID;
   VV = 0 if attribute is valid;
   and if VV = 0:
    JJJJ = length of attribute data;
    DD = attribute data (JJJJ bytes.)

  For example:

  0x0001 0x41   (Variable name: "A")
  0x00          (???)
  0x0006        (6 attributes present)
  0x0002        (Attribute number 2 / data type:)
   0x00 0x0004  (Attribute is valid, data is 4 bytes)
   0xF0070000   (Data type.)
  0x0003        (Attribute number 3 / is variable archived?:)
   0x00 0x0001  (Attribute is valid, data is 1 byte)
   0x00         (Variable is not archived.)
  0x0005        (Attribute number 5)
   0x01         (Attribute is invalid)
  0x0001        (Attribute number 1 / variable data size:)
   0x00 0x0004  (Attribute is valid, data is 4 bytes)
   0x00000009   (Variable data is 9 bytes.)
  0x0041        (Attribute number 41)
   0x01         (Attribute is invalid)
  0x0042        (Attribute number 42)
   0x01         (Attribute is invalid)

  Known attributes:
   0x0001	4 bytes	Variable size
   0x0002	4 bytes	Variable type
   0x0003	1 byte	Is archived / in Flash
   0x0004	1 byte	Unknown (always 0).
   0x0005	4 bytes	First four bytes of an AppVar. By TI's convention, the first four
					bytes identify the program that created the AppVar.
   0x0008	1 byte	Variable "version".  This is 0 for most variables, but 1 for programs
					that include 83+-specific functions (and thus won't work on an 82 or 83.) 
					It's probably increased for 84+-specific functions as well.
   0x0008	4 bytes Set to 1 when sending app on Titanium (Titanium only).
   0x0011	4 bytes	Variable type : used for requesting variables instead of type 0x0002.
   0x0013	1 byte	Unknown (always 0, used for deleting of variable)
   0x0041	1 byte	Is locked
   0x0042	1 byte	Unknown

  A variable type is the standard type ID plus either 0xF0030000,
  0xF0070000, or 0xF00B0000.  (Perhaps this varies with the device
  type.)
  Titanium: 0xF00C0000.


 Type 0x000B: Request to Send
 ----------------------------

  This is a variation of the variable header packet.  Its contents are:

   LL LL UU ... 00 | 00 00 00 09 01 NN NN ( II II JJ JJ DD ... ) ...
			    \/   \_varsize_/ \?/
			    |
				NULL terminator			 


  LLLL = length of name;
  UU = variable name in UTF-8 (LLLL bytes);
  NNNN = number of attributes;
  and for each attribute:
   IIII = 16-bit attribute ID (see above);
   JJJJ = length of attribute data;
   DD = attribute data (JJJJ bytes.)

  Note the lack of VV bytes, as all attributes the PC is sending are
  presumably valid.


 Type 0x000C: Variable Request
 -----------------------------

  This is also a variation of the variable header packet.  It requests
  both a variable header and the variable contents, so it includes
  BOTH a list of attributes the PC provides (data type) and a list of
  attributes the calculator needs to provide (variable size, is it
  archived?)  Its contents are:

                       /----- ?????????? -----\
   LL LL UU ... 0x00 | 0x01 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF
   NN NN ( II II ) ...
   MM MM ( II II JJ JJ DD ... ) 0x00 0x00
                                \- ??? -/

  LLLL = length of name;
  UU = variable name in UTF-8 (LLLL bytes);
  NNNN = number of attributes requested;
  for each attribute:
   IIII = 16-bit attribute ID;
  MMMM = number of attributes specified;
  for each attribute:
   IIII = 16-bit attribute ID;
   JJJJ = length of attribute data;
   DD = attribute data (JJJJ bytes.)

  Note: When you specify the variable type, you must use attribute
  0x0011 rather than 0x0002.  I don't know why.


 Type 0x000D: Variable Contents
 ------------------------------

  This packet simply contains the contents of the variable previously
  agreed upon.  All meta-data is sent as part of the 0x000A or 0x000B
  packet.


 Type 0x000E: Parameter Set
 --------------------------

  This packet attempts to set a parameter value.
  You can also remotely assign values to certain parameters.  (This is
  the way to set the clock, for instance.)  To set a parameter, send an
  0x000E packet containing:

   II II LL LL DD ...

  The calculator will either acknowledge with 0xAA00, or return an
  0x0022 error if the parameter ID is invalid.  Note that only one
  parameter can be set at once.


 Type 0x0010: Delete Variable/Application
 ----------------------------------------

  This is yet another variation of the variable header packet.  Its
  contents are:

   LL LL UU ... 0x00 | NN NN ( II II JJ JJ DD ... ) ...
   0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00

  LLLL = length of name;
  UU = variable name in UTF-8 (LLLL bytes);
  NNNN = number of attributes;
  and for each attribute:
   IIII = 16-bit attribute ID (see above);
   JJJJ = length of attribute data;
   DD = attribute data (JJJJ bytes.)

  If successful, the calculator sends an 0xAA00 (Acknowledgement of
  Data) packet in response.

 Type 0x0011: Remote Control
 ---------------------------

  This packet allows to:
  - remotely execute: a program, an assembly program or a FLASH application by its name
  - enqueue a single key
  
  The contents of this packet are:

	LL UU ... 0x00 LL UU ... 0x00 | AC | unformatted DATA ...
      \_________/    \_________/
	    folder		   varname

  LL = length of variable's name;
  UU = variable name in UTF-8 (LLLL bytes);
  AC = action

  Known actions and remarks:
   0x00		run program by name				folder may be empty
											data = comma-separated parameters in TI-charset
											(those passed to function/program); may be empty, hopefully...
											no error is returned if number of args don't match
   0x01		run assembly program by name	same
   0x02		run FLASH application by name	folder and data must be empty
   0x03		enqueue key						folder and varname must be empty, 
											data = key code in TI endianess (MSB first on TI89, LSB first on TI84+)
   0x04		send stuffs						not supported? always produces error 41 (0x29), may be 84+ only
   
   Example:
   	00 (no folder)
		05 'h' 'e' 'l' 'l' 'o' 00 (varname)
		00 (run PRGM)
		'1' ',' '2' (params)

	00 00 03 00 41	send 'A' key


 Type 0x0012: Acknowledgement of Mode Setting
 --------------------------------------------

  This packet is sent in response to a ping.  Its contents are four
  bytes: the same XXXXXXXX value sent in the ping.


 Type 0xAA00: Acknowledgement of Data
 ------------------------------------

  This packet is sent to acknowledge many different commands.  Its
  contents are a single byte, which always appears to be 1.


 Type 0xBB00
 -----------

  This is a strange one.  The calculator appears to ignore this packet
  when it is received.  Sometimes it is sent after an 0x0007 packet is
  received; sometimes it isn't.  It usually contains the number
  0x0001d4c0 (120000) or 0x00057E40 (360000).

  [Incidentally, I have an idea about the BB00 packet.  Its contents seem to
	be used as a timeout.  Perhaps it simply means "wait for X milliseconds
	for the next packet," and it's sent whenever the calculator expects to
	take a long time to respond.  That would seem to make sense in the
	contexts where it is used.]


 Type 0xDD00: End of Transmission
 --------------------------------

  This packet is sent when an OS transfer or directory listing is
  done.


 Type 0xEE00: Error
 ------------------

  This packet indicates an error; the contents are a 2-byte error
  code.

  Error codes include:
    00 04 = invalid argument or name
	00 06 = can't delete app
	00 08 = transmission error or invalid code
	00 09 = using basic mode while being in boot mode
	00 0c = out of memory
	00 0d = invalid folder name?
	00 0e = invalid name
	00 12 = can't overwrite, variable is locked/archived
	00 1c = mode token too small
	00 1d = mode token too large
	00 22 = invalid parameter ID
	00 29 = remote control?
	00 2b = battery low (sending OS)
	00 34 = invalid FLASH app?


6  Variable Transfers
---------------------

 Transferring variable data is done by the same overall method used in
 the DBUS protocol.  Before sending or requesting a variable, you may
 want to retrieve a directory listing, which is done as follows:

  PC->TI: Request Directory Listing (0x0009)
  TI->PC: Variable Header (0x000A)
  TI->PC: Variable Header (0x000A)
  ...
  TI->PC: End of Transmission (0xDD00)  

 To request a variable to be sent:

  PC->TI: Request Variable (0x000C)
  TI->PC: Variable Header (0x000A)
  TI->PC: Variable Contents (0x000D)

 To request to send a variable (silently):

  PC->TI: Request to Send (0x000B)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xAA00)
  PC->TI: Variable Contents (0x000D)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xAA00)
  PC->TI: End of Transmission (0xDD00)

 To request that a variable/application be deleted:

  PC->TI: Delete Variable (0x0010)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xBB00), Titanium only or TI84+ when deleting FLASH app (garbage collecing).
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xAA00)


7  Flash Transfers
------------------

 Transferring FLASH apps is done by the same overall method used in
 the DBUS protocol.  

 To request a FLASH app to be sent (same as requesting of var):

  PC->TI: Request Variable (0x000C)
  TI->PC: Variable Header (0x000A)
  TI->PC: Variable Contents (0x000D)

 To request to send a FLASH app:

  PC->TI: Request to Send (0x000B)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xBB00)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xAA00)

  PC->TI: Variable Contents (0x000D)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xBB00)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xAA00)

  PC->TI: End of Transmission (0xDD00)


8 OS Transfers
--------------

 Transferring FLASH OS is done on the following scheme:
  
  PC->TI: Ping / Set Mode (to basic mode)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0x0012)

  PC->TI: Begin OS Transfer (0x0002)
	  TI->PC: Buffer Size Request (size = 256 + 10 bytes)	(*)
	  PC->TI: Buffer Size Negotiation						(*)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge of OS Transfer (0x0003)

  PC->TI: OS Header (0x0004)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xBB00), Titanium only
  TI->PC: Acknowledge of OS Transfer (0x0003)

  PC->TI: OS Data (0x0005)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xBB00), Titanium only
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xAA00)
	...
  PC->TI: OS Data (0x0005)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xBB00), Titanium only
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xAA00)

  PC->TI: End Of Transmission (0xDD00)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xBB00), TI84+ only
  TI->PC: Acknowledge of EOT (0x0006)

  Note (TI84+): 
	OS header and first packet have AAAA=4000, PP=7A, FF=80.
	Last packet has AAAA=4100, PP=7A, FF=80. 
	Others begins with AAAA=4000 and FF=00.

  Note (Titanium):
    OS header contains the certificate part.
	Other packets are raw data.

  (*) the negotiation takes place on the first transfer attempt. If transfer failed (hand-held
  in boot mode, waiting for OS receival), then this step is skipped.


9  Calculator Parameters
------------------------

 A great deal of non-variable data (much more than was ever available
 through the DBUS protocol) is available in the form of "parameters."
 These are simply strings of binary data which can be read from (and
 some written to) the calculator.

 The following parameters are present on the TI-84 Plus as of OS 2.40
 and Titanium as of OS 3.00:

 (B = parameter available in boot mode; W = parameter writable.)

 ID    B  W  Type       Description

 0001  *     Int32      Product number? (0x0000000A for the 84 Plus)
 0002  *     String     Product name, e.g. "TI-84 Plus Silver Edition"
 0003  *     5 bytes    Main part of calculator ID in binary (TI84+), Full part of ID-LIST in ASCII (Titanium)

 001F        Int16      LCD height?
 0022        768 bytes  LCD contents
 0023        Byte       Unknown (always 1)
 0024     *  Byte       0 = clock off, 1 = clock on
 0025     *  Int32      Clock (seconds since 1997 Jan 1)
 0027     *  Byte       0 = Y/M/D, 1 = M/D/Y, 2 = D/M/Y | 3 = M.D.Y, 4 = D.M.Y, 5 = Y.M.D, 6 = M-D-Y, 7 = D-M-Y, 8 = Y-M-D (Titanium date style)
 0028     *  Byte       0 = 12 hour, 1 = 24 hour mode
 0029        Byte       Unknown (always 0)
 002D  *     Byte       0 = battery low, 1 = battery good
 0030     *  32 bytes   Unknown
 0031        Unknown    List of Certificates
 0032     *  Byte       Unknown (0 or 1 according to system flag 5,(iy+51))
 0036        16 bytes   Calculator ID, maybe?
 0037     *  Byte       0 = not at homescreen, 1 = at homescreen
 0038        Byte       Unknown (always 0)
 0039        Byte       0 = screen not split, 1 = screen split

 To request a parameter to be sent

  PC->TI: Request Parameter (0x0007)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xBB00), TI84+ only
  TI->PC: Parameter Data (0x0008)

 To request to send a parameter

  PC->TI: Parameter Set (0x000E)
  TI->PC: Acknowledge (0xAA00)
  
Beware: it seems that requesting more than 16 parameters at a time makes Titanium less responsive
	for a while (1 to 2 seconds).
