About the 'Packet Decompiler':

the packet decompiler is a very simple program used to insulate packets from the flow of data containes in the log files.

The program can be used after a preliminary analysis (that is to say analyze log by hand,
extract the format, writing the doc, ...) to automatize further analysis...

Very useful !
