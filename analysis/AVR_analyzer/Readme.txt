AVR analyzer, version 1.4

This archive contains program and source code of the AVRanalyzer for Linux/Windows9x 
(not NT4). It is provided as is in the hope to be useful. I do not provide any support 
for it.

The program spies the transmission between a TI calculator and the PC. The AVRanalyzer is
plugged thru a 'T'. It decodes the exchanged bytes and send them on its RS232 serial port.
So, you have directly the decoded bytes on a COM port for instance.

You can use my RS232 sampler for receiving data.

I have tested the AVRanalyzer with a Grey TIGL (9600 bauds) and a home-made parallel link 
cable (45 Kbit/s) with the AVRanalyzer at 57600 bauds. All have worked fine !

Have fun !
