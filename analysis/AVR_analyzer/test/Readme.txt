This directory contains 2 test programs:
- one for testing the RS232 in sending
- the other for testing the RS232 in receiving (echo)

For this, simply execute a_echo.bat or a_out.bat and go in the root
directory of the archive for launching the AVRprommer and next the terminal via 'term.bat'.

Beware: you have to slightly modify the ASM files according to your quartz frequency !
Default values are for 11.0592 MHz but you have also values for a 
10 MHz crystal.
