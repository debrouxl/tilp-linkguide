This folder contains tools and guide-lines used for doing the
various logs.

1°) My first method (with TI-GraphLink software) : DSP Starter Kit (DSK)

Some offsets used by my DSK tools for storing data:
- CblExpmt: 31000
- Conics (acf2b3e.8xk): 22000
- ProbSi83: 36000 ?
- ChemBio: 23000
- TI83PlusOS114.8XU: 260000

2°) My second method (w/ TI-GraphLink software) : GrayLink + AVR Analyzer + RS232_log

The AVR analyzer is a µC which realize a D-BUS/RS232 bridge at 57600 bauds.
The RS232_log provides an hexdump log which can be processed with log2pkt.exe.

Note: BlackLink seems to be too fast for analyzer. Long packets have lost bytes.

3°) My third method (with Ti-Connect software) : UsbSnoopy

Use SnoopyPro to sniff USB packet and get an XML log.

With SilverLink: use SnoopyPro; the XML log can be processed with xml2log and with log2pkt next.
With DirectLink: use SniffUsb; the log file must be processed with snif2pkt.
	SniffUsb needs a reboot before use.

4°) When the hand-held is not available but the TI emulator is:

- fastAVRlink/GrayLink on COM2 (TiLP)
- DSK on the 'T'
- GreyLink on COM1 (TI's SDK)

At the time where I have added my analysis tools to the link guide, 
methods 2 & 3 were used.

5°) Since April 2007, I use another method: GrayLink + RS232_log

I built a RS232 'T' made-up of 2 SUB-D 25 connectors and 1 SUB-D 9 connector.
Both connectors are wired 1:1 and RxD & TxD signals are wired to the SUB-D 9
connector thru 2 silicon diodes (electrical OR).

GrayLink is on COM1, RS232_log on COM2.
